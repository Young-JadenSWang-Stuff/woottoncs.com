            1. Keep habit of sustaining whatever you are using. Don't switch between buttons
            and anchor links. 
            2. For DOM selectors that will only be used once, or is the only DOM element in the
            page, use "id" and select with "#selector" instead of class for better organizing
            3. Ignore my code editor's weird formatting on a tags. You can put it in one line
            if you want to.

            - Despite instance variables being marked private, the variables can still be accessed because the class is created and owned
            by you, the class programmer
            <br /> - To Access the instance variable, the object must be of the same class
            <br /> - Since Objects merely POINT to the location on the heap from the stack, everything that is not a primitive
            or a string must be deep copied. This is to avoid changing the data in array2 when editing array1
