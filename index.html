            1) Despite instance variables being marked private, the variables can still be accessed because the class is created and owned by you, the class programmer<br/> 2) To Access the instance variable, the object must be of the same class<br/>            3) Since Objects merely POINT to the location on the heap from the stack, everything that is not a primitive or a string must be deep copied. This is to avoid changing the data in array2 when editing array1

                    1) You must be able to explain in english, what the relationships between a
                    <mark>CLASS PROGRAMMER</mark>, a <mark>CLIENT PROGRAMMER</mark>, and a <mark>USER</mark> are.<br/> 2) The use of the word User most likely means you are doing something incorrect<br/> 3) No Multiple Choice will be on the quiz<br/>                    4) Quoting Turner: "You do not need to repeat the question back to him on the paper, this may save some of you some time. <br/>

                1) Constructors must have the same name as the class name<br/>
                2) Any Exception can be thrown but IllegalArgumentException is the most common one for incorrect input<br/>
                3) Constructors can have the same name but still be legal because of the different parameter rule<br/>
                4) Using this.(n,50) in line 17 can be used to initialize the object without changing <br/>
                5) Drives or Client Classes are only neccessary for Projects, not Homeworks<br/>
                6) All HELPER functions must be set as private as the client should not be able to use these methods

                1) All File IO should have a try-catch catching FileNotFoundExceptions or IOExceptions<br/>
                2) File Input/Output has<br/>
                - .nextLine() reads every line, there is no .nextString() method<br/>
                - .nextInt() reads until the next int<br/>
                - .nextDouble() reads until the next double<br/>
                3) To move the "cursor" where the compuer looks at each line, the scanner must be reinitialized
                4) any .nextMethod drives the cursor forward
